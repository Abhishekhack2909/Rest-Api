## Installation & Setup

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the server:
```bash
npm start
```

For development with auto-reload:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will automatically find an available port (default: 3000, fallback: 5000, etc.)

## 🌐 Web Interface

Once the server is running, open your web browser and go to:
```

http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

You'll see a beautiful web interface where you can:
- ➕ Create new notes
- 📝 Edit existing notes
- 🗑️ Delete notes
- 🔄 Refresh the notes list

## Quick Test

Once the server is running, you can quickly test it:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/

# Testing Methods

### Method 1: Command Line (curl)
Use the curl commands shown above in your terminal/PowerShell.

### Method 2: Web Interface (Recommended)
- Open `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your browser for the full web app
- Use the intuitive interface to create, edit, and delete notes

### Method 3: Direct API Browser Testing

- Get all notes: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/notes`
- Get specific note: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/notes/1`

### Method 4: API Testing Tools
- **Postman**: Import the endpoints and test with a GUI
- **Thunder Client** (VS Code extension): Test directly in VS Code
- **Insomnia**: Another popular API testing tool

## Example Test Flow

1. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Create your first note:**
   ```bash
   # Windows PowerShell
   curl -Method POST -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:5000/notes" -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"title": "My First Note", "content": "Hello World!"}'
   ```

3. **View all notes:**
   ```bash
   curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/notes
   ```

4. **Update the note:**
   ```bash
   # Windows PowerShell
   curl -Method PUT -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:5000/notes/1" -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"title": "Updated Note", "content": "Updated content!"}'
   ```

5. **Delete the note:**
   ```bash
   # Windows PowerShell
   curl -Method DELETE -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:5000/notes/1"
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
If you get an "EADDRINUSE" error, the port is already taken. The server will automatically try different ports (3000, 5000, etc.). Check the console output to see which port it's using.

### Common Issues
- Make sure Node.js is installed
- Run `npm install` before starting
- Check that the server is running before testing endpoints
- Use the correct port number shown in the console output
